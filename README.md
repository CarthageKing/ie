Intervention Engine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intervention-engine/ie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intervention-engine/ie)
===================================================================================================================================================

The Intervention Engine project provides a web-application for *data-driven team huddles*. Many care teams use team huddles to improve patient outcomes via efficient team communications and a holistic view of patients (due to the interdisciplinary nature of team huddles). Intervention Engine leverages electronic clinical records and clinical risk assessments to assist care teams in selecting patients for their huddles and providing the tools necessary to promote effective discussions and interventions.

Intervention Engine is a work in progress. Current Intervention Engine features:

-	huddle management
	-	assign patients to huddles based on risk scores
	-	assign patients to huddles based on recent encounters (e.g., ED Visit)
	-	manually assign patients to huddles
	-	mark patients as "discussed"
-	custom population filters based on age, gender, conditions, and encounter types
-	clinical risk assessment integration via an open API
	-	prototype stroke risk calculation service (based on CHA2DS2-VASc)
	-	prototype "negative outcomes" risk calculation service (condition count + medication count)
-	patient views w/ summary data, risk trends, and risk component visualization
-	FHIR-based REST server
-	C-CDA import

Still to come:

-	Population views and visualizations
-	SMART-on-FHIR integration

The ie Repository
-----------------

The *ie* repository contains the source code for the backend Intervention Engine server. The *ie* server provides RESTful services needed by other components of the Intervention Engine stack. In addition to custom Intervention Engine features (such as authentication, notifications, and insta-count), it also doubles as a FHIR server (by integrating code from the [fhir](https://github.com/intervention-engine/fhir) repository).

Building and Running ie Locally
-------------------------------
